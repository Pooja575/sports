# Software Engineer Intern Assessment Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Software Engineer Intern Assessment Project! This project aims to evaluate your skills in several key areas relevant to our team. You will be working on a small application that retrieves data from an API, stores it in a database, and displays it in a simple user interface. This project is intended to be open-ended, allowing you to be creative and choose whatever language or framework you are comfortable with. 

## Project Requirements

### Required Abilities to Demonstrate

1. **Ability to use Git**
   - Clone the repository
   - Create a new branch for your work
   - Commit changes with clear messages
   - Push your branch to the remote repository and open a merge request

2. **Ability to Retrieve Data from an API**
   - Fetch data from a public API
   - Handle possible errors and edge cases

3. **Ability to Work with a Database**
   - Store the retrieved data in a local database
   - Ensure the database is set up correctly and can be easily accessed

4. **Ability to Create a UI with Simple Functionality**
   - Display the retrieved data in a user-friendly interface
   - Implement basic interactivity, such as filtering or sorting the data
   - For additional points, consider adding at least 1 data visualization.

### Additional Skills to Showcase

- **Documentation**
  - Write clear and concise documentation for your code and the project setup

- **Testing**
  - Implement basic tests for your code to ensure functionality

- **Code Quality**
  - Follow best practices for code organization and readability

## Project Outline

1. **Setup**
   - Clone this repository
   - Set up your development environment
   - Create a new branch for your work

2. **API Integration**
   - Choose a public API to fetch data from (e.g., a sports related API)
   - Write a script to retrieve data from the API
   - Handle errors and edge cases appropriately

3. **Database Integration**
   - Set up a local database (e.g., SQLite)
   - Create a schema to store the API data
   - Write code to save the retrieved data into the database

4. **User Interface**
   - Create a simple web interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a framework like React
   - Display the data retrieved from the database
   - Add basic interactivity (e.g., filtering, sorting)

5. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Write documentation on how to set up and run your project
   - Implement basic tests for your code

6. **Submission**
   - Commit your changes with clear messages
   - Push your branch to the remote repository
   - Open a merge request for review

## Key Project Outcomes

- **Functionality**
  - The application correctly fetches, stores, and displays data
  - Basic interactivity in the UI is functional

- **Code Quality**
  - Code is well-organized and follows best practices
  - Documentation is clear and complete
  - Basic tests are implemented and pass

- **Communication**
  - Clear commit messages and merge request description
  - Ability to discuss your approach and thought process during the follow-up meeting
