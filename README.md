# Software Engineer Intern Assessment Project

Deadline: September 15, 2024 @ 23:59

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Software Engineer Intern Assessment Project! This project aims to evaluate your skills in several key areas relevant to our team. You will be working on a small application that retrieves data from an API, stores it in a database, and displays it in a simple user interface. This project is intended to be open-ended, allowing you to be creative and choose whatever language or framework you are comfortable with. However, we will provide some guidance and tips to get started with the tools we love (P.S. We use Next.JS framework, with React, Tailwind, Typescript, and Postgres)

## Project Requirements :memo:

### Required Abilities to Demonstrate

1. **Ability to use Git**
   - Fork this repository
   - Clone your forked repository
   - Create a new branch for your work
   - Commit changes often with clear messages
   - Push your branch to the remote repository and open a merge request

2. **Ability to Retrieve Data from an API**
   - Fetch data from a public sports-related API
   - Handle possible errors and edge cases

3. **Ability to Work with a Database**
   - Store the retrieved data in a local database
   - Ensure the database is set up correctly and can be easily accessed

4. **Ability to Create a UI with Simple Functionality**
   - Display the retrieved data in a user-friendly interface
   - Implement basic interactivity, such as filtering or sorting the data
   - For additional points, consider adding at least 1 data visualization

### Additional Skills to Showcase

- **Documentation**
  - Write clear and concise documentation for your code and the project setup

- **Testing**
  - Implement basic tests for your code to ensure functionality

- **Code Quality**
  - Follow best practices for code organization and readability

## Project Outline :books:

1. **Setup**
   - Fork this repository
   - Clone your forked repository
   - Set up your development environment
   - Create a new branch for your work
   > **Tip**: Check out [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/learn) if you are looking for a easy to use full-stack framework

2. **API Integration**
   - Choose a public sports-related API to fetch data from (e.g., [SportAPI](https://rapidapi.com/rapidsportapi/api/sportapi7))
   - Sign up for a free API key if needed
   - Write a script to retrieve data from the API
   - Handle errors and edge cases appropriately

3. **Database Integration**
   - Set up a local database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite, mySQL)
   - Create a schema to store the API data
   - Write code to save the retrieved data into the database
   > **Tip**: Use an ORM like [Prisma for Typescript](https://www.prisma.io/) or [SQLAlchemy for Python](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/) to make working with your DB easier. The Next JS tutorial above provides steps on how to set up a postgres DB with an ORM.


4. **User Interface**
   - Create a simple web interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a framework like React
   - Display the data retrieved from the database
   - Add basic interactivity (e.g., filtering, sorting)
   > **Tip**: If you decide to go with React, try using a pre-made component library like [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to speed up your development. Additionally you may also find using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), which makes CSS styling much easier. Using NextJS should automatically set this up for you!
   
5. **Documentation and Testing**
   - Write documentation on how to set up and run your project
   - Implement basic tests for your code

6. **Submission**
   - Commit your changes with clear messages
   - Push your branch to the remote repository
   - Open a merge request for review
   > **Note**: Only commits submitted before dealine will be considered. Make sure to commit early and often!

## Key Project Outcomes :trophy:

- **Functionality**
  - The application correctly fetches, stores, and displays data
  - Basic interactivity in the UI is functional

- **Code Quality**
  - Code is well-organized and follows best practices
  - Documentation is clear and complete
  - Basic tests are implemented and pass

- **Communication**
  - Clear commit messages and merge request description
  - Ability to discuss your approach and thought process during the follow-up meeting
